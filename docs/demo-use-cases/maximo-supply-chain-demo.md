**Maximo Agentic Solution: AI-Driven Work Order Optimization**

## Description

IBM's **Maximo Agentic Solution** integrates intelligent AI agents with **IBM Maximo** to automate and optimize key maintenance workflows. This solution empowers asset-intensive industries with smarter, more efficient operations by embedding autonomous decision-making into core maintenance processes.

The solution features three specialized agents:

* **Weather Agent**
  Automatically checks weather conditions based on the work order's location and schedules or delays work accordinglyâ€”ensuring field activities are planned under favorable conditions.

* **Inventory Agent**
  Analyzes the work order description, identifies the required materials, checks inventory availability, and updates the work order with the necessary itemsâ€”minimizing delays and manual tracking.

* **Labor Agent**
  Determines the skill or craft needed for the task, verifies qualified labor availability, and assigns them to the work orderâ€”reducing scheduling overhead and ensuring the right personnel are deployed.

Together, these agents streamline the end-to-end work order processâ€”reducing manual effort, minimizing errors, and enabling intelligent, context-aware decision-making within Maximo.
