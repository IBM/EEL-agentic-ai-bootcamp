Here's a scenario: "Member Sarah submits a claim for a specialist visit and subsequent lab tests." We'll define a few agents, each with a specific role and toolset. There will also be a "Master Orchestrator Agent" (often implicit or part of the platform) that routes tasks between agents.|[Get started ➡️](../../use-cases-for-labs/pro-code/insurance-claim-post/insurance-claim-post-hospitalization)
