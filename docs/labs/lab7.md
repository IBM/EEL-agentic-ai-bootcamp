## Building your AI assistant with actions

In the AI Assistant Builder, an action is a specific outcome your AI assistant completes in response to a user's request. Actions consist of steps, which guide the conversation between the user and the AI assistant. The interaction starts with user input (e.g., "I want to withdraw money"), may involve additional exchanges for gathering information, and concludes when the assistant fulfils the request.
You can design AI assistants that function like personal assistants by creating AI-guided actions, skill-based actions, or custom-built actions.
The examples in this guide demonstrate building a money withdrawal action. You can modify these to suit your own use case.

## To create AI assistant , do the following steps

1.	Enter Assistant Name
    In the "Assistant name" field, enter a meaningful name for your assistant. Example: Fund Management Bot (or any other relevant name based on your use case). The name is used internally and is not visible to end users.
2.	Provide a Description (Optional)
    You can add a short description that summarizes the purpose of this assistant.Example: "A chatbot to assist users with fund management queries and investment options."This step is optional but helps in organizing multiple assistants.
3.	Select Assistant Language
    From the "Assistant language" dropdown, choose the preferred language for the assistant.By default, English (U.S.) is selected.
4.	Proceed to the Next Step
    Click the "Next" button at the top-right corner to continue to the Personalization step.

    In the "Which industry do you work in?" dropdown, select your industry.Example: Banking and Financial Services (if the assistant is for a finance-related use case).
3.	Define Your Role
    In "What is your role on the team building the assistant?", choose the most relevant role. Example: Designer, Developer, Product Manager, etc.
4.	Select a Need Statement
