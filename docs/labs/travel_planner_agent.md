!!! info "Agentic AI Framework Details"

    - **Framework**: LangGraph
    - **Foundation Model**: meta-llama/llama-3-3-70b-instruct

## Use case

### Travel planner agent

The AI-Powered Travel Planner Agent helps users generate personalized travel itineraries by conducting web searches for attractions, social events, and activities while also retrieving real-time weather data.

Key Features:

- Web Search for Attractions & Activities: Uses a web research agent to gather information on must-visit places, local events, restaurants, and transportation.
- Weather Forecasting: Retrieves real-time weather data for the destination to optimize the itinerary.
- Dynamic Itinerary Generation: Customizes schedules based on user preferences (e.g., adventure, culture, relaxation) and weather conditions.

## Steps

### Get familiarized with Agent Lab on watsonx.ai

1. Login to <https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/> to access the watsonx.ai platform. And create a sandbox project to get started.

    ![1](../images/lab1/1.png)

1. Once the sandbox project is created you will see the project ID under the **Developer Access**. Save it in a notepad as it will be useful in next labs. 
    
    ![3](../images/lab1/3.png)

    !!! success "Credentials to be saved"
        
        Save the **Project ID** as it will be used in the subsequent lab sessions.

1. Click on the **Build an AI agent to automate tasks** to open the Agent Lab.

    ![5](../images/lab1/5.png)

1. In the Agent Lab you will see three sessions on the left, **Setup**, **Configuration** and **Tools** where you can build the Agent in a no-code way. And on the right side you will see the **Agent Preview**. Try asking any question such as:
    ```
    How is IBM Stock performing?
    ```

    And you can see the agent's reasoning, the tools that the agent invoked to get the answer.

### Build Travel Planner Agent

1. Next, lets create the travel planner agent.
    - Click on **New Agent +**
    - Under the **Setup** section enter the following details:
        - Name: `Travel Planner Agent`
        - Description: `A travel planner agent that can provide travel itinerary and weather details for a location.`
        - You can choose the Icon and Placeholder image as per your likings.
        - Quick start questions: `I am planning a trip to New York city next week. Can you get me information about the tourist attractions, weather forecast and social events?` Click on the **+** button to add it.

1. Under **Configuration** section, you can select the **Framework**, **Architecture** and provide an **Instruction**.
    - Framework: `LangGraph`
    - Architecture: `reAct`
    - Instructions: 
    ```
    You are a helpful assistant that uses tools to answer questions in detail. Keep the tone conversational.
    Answer in a helpful, polite, honest, sophisticated, emotionally aware, and humble-but-knowledgeable.
    The assistant prioritizes caution over usefulness, refusing to answer questions that it considers unsafe, immoral, unethical or dangerous.
    Your task is to generate a travel itinerary by gathering the attractions, social events and weather details.
    You can use markdown to format your responses in a structured manner.
    ```

1. Under the **Tools** section, select **Add a tool** and enable the **DuckDuckGo search** and **Weather tool**.

    ![9](../images/lab1/9.png)  

1. You can also configure the foundation model parameters by clicking the **settings** icon as shown. We'll leave it default for this agent.

    ![10](../images/lab1/10.png)  

1. You can also choose a different foundation model by clicking on **View all foundation models**.

    ![11](../images/lab1/11.png)  

1. You will be presented with the model catalog.  We'll use the `llama-3-3-70b-instruct` to build this agent.

    ![12](../images/lab1/12.png)  

1. Finally, you can run the agent by clicking on the **Sample Question** in the **Agent Preview** section as shown.
    
    ![13](../images/lab1/13.png)  

1. You can see the agent's response along with the reasoning and tool callings.

    ![15](../images/lab1/15.png)  

### Save the Agent

1. Click on the **Save** button on top right, and select **save as**.
    ![16](../images/lab1/16.png)  

1. You will see three options to save the agent:
    1. **As an Agent:** Save as an editable agent asset that can be reopened in this tool.
    1. **As a standard notebook:** Save the current agent as a Jupyter notebook.
    1. **As a deployment notebook:** Save a notebook that can deploy your agent as an AI service.
    Click on the **Agent** and save it.

    ![17](../images/lab1/17.png)  

1. You can click on the **user icon** and view/edit the agents from here.
    
    ![18](../images/lab1/18.png)  

### Deploy the agent as an AI Service

1. Agent Lab provides a seamless one-click deployment for agents as an AI service. Click on the **Deploy** button.
    ![19](../images/lab1/19.png)  

1. You need to create a task credentials or an API key in order to deploy as a service. Click on the banner to create an API key.
    
    ![20](../images/lab1/20.png)  

1. You will be redirected to the user page where you can create an API key. Once created navigate back to the previous page.
    
    ![21](../images/lab1/21.png)  

1. Click on **Reload**.

    ![22](../images/lab1/22.png)  

1. Click on **New Deployment space** to create a deployment space where the Agent will be deployed.
    
    ![23](../images/lab1/23.png)  

1. Enter the details and create the deployment space.
    
    ![24](../images/lab1/24.png)  

1. Click on **Reload** and you will see the deployment space available. Click on deploy.
    
    ![25](../images/lab1/25.png)  

1. You will see a notification that says: **Deployment has started**. Click on **View status** to go to the deployment space.
    
    ![27](../images/lab1/27.png)  

1. Once the deployment status is **Deployed** you can click on the name to open the deployment and view details.
    
    ![28](../images/lab1/28.png)  

1. You will see three tabs, **API reference**, **Test**, **Preview**. You can see the production ready public and private endpoints for your deployed agent. You can also see the deployment ID, save it in a notepad as it will be used lated to import this agent in watsonx Orchestrate.
    
    ![29](../images/lab1/29.png)  
    
    !!! success "Credentials to be saved"
        
        Save the **Deployment ID** as it will be used in the subsequent lab sessions.

1. Click on **Test** tab and you can test the service endpoint. Enter the following as a payload and click on **Predict**.
    - role: `user`
    - content: `I am planning a trip to New York city next week. Can you get me information about the tourist attractions, weather forecast and social events?`

    ![30](../images/lab1/30.png)

1. You will see the same results from the agent as a response from the service endpoint.
