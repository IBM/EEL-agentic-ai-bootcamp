# üßë‚Äçüíº AskHR: Automate HR tasks with Agentic AI

## Pre-requisites

- Make sure you've already setup the environment:
- [Lab 0 - Environment setup](../../../../labs/env-setup-lab/)
- [ADK Installation](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/getting_started/installing){:target="_blank"}
- [Download files](https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/ip9fq5u0b8pty8dvrlza8ikrs8cel4xg){:target="_blank"} 
- Download the zip file from Lab1 folder <br>
Note: If you are an instructor, complete the instructor guide and update the url in hr.yaml. If you are a practitioner, obtain the updated hr.yaml file from your instructor. Do not directly use the yaml file to import into Orchestrate. 
- If you are an instructor, complete the [instructor set-up guide](https://ibm.github.io/EEL-agentic-ai-bootcamp/use-cases-for-labs/low-code/chro/lab-guide/) and update the hr.yaml with new url after completing the setup.

4. Select "Create from scratch", give your agent a name, e.g. "HR Agent", and fill in the description as shown below:

    You are an agent who handles employee HR queries.  You provide short and crisp responses, keeping the output to 200 words or less.  You can help users check their profile data, retrieve latest time off balance, update title or address, and request time off. You can also answer general questions about company benefits.
    ```

14. Scroll down to the **Behavior** section. Insert the instructions below into the **Instructions** field:

    ```
    Use your knowledge base to answer general questions about employee benefits. 

    Use the tools to get or update user specific information.

    When user asks to show profile data or check time off balance or update title/address or request time off for the very first time,  first ask the user for their name,  then invoke the tool and then use the same name in the whole session without asking for the name again.

    When the user requests time off, convert the dates to YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. 5/22/2025 should be converted to 2025-05-22 before passing the date to the post_request_time_off tool.
    ```
