# Financial research and analysis use case

## Overview

Consider a wealth bank, where a Financial Advisor (Mary) is meeting a client (John) and needs to prepare for the meeting to provide investment advice. Typically, Mary must go through various data points before meeting John for financial advisory which is at least 1-2 hrs of effort. With the **financial research and analysis agent**, she can efficiently generate a detailed report for client's portfolio by asking something like “Give me a report on John Doe’s stock investment portfolio” and the agent will gather data from multiple sources, summarize and generate a report within minutes. Additionally, she can also do an risk assessment of the portfolio by asking something like "Give me a risk assessment report on the portfolio" and the financial research and analysis will collaborate with an external agent that can perform detailed risk assessment and get the results. Post meeting, typically she would spend at least 30min to 1hr to summarize the key decisions that were suggested during the meeting. With the **financial research and analysis agent**, she can summarize meeting transcripts and draft an email and send it within minutes with just asking something like "Get the transcript from the previous meeting with John Doe and create an email". Mary can also use the **financial research and analysis agent** to get Market & Financial Insights. She can ask queries such as: “How does the US equity market compare to the rest of world?”, "How have interest rate cuts impacted valuations?", "What is Goldman’s outlook on global diversification?" and so on... the agent will Retrieve relevant information on market trends, stock performance, and financial topics to answer the questions.
