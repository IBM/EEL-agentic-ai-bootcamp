# Document processing agentic AI workflow

## Overview

This lab focuses on a practical use case involving document classification, followed by key data extraction from both unstructured documents (primarily contracts) and structured ones (such as invoices). At the outset, the guide outlines the sequence of activities required to support the user journey of extracting essential information from uploaded documents.

In this lab scenario, a financial services firm processes numerous contracts and invoices weekly, extracting critical information like payment terms, amounts, and due dates. Currently, this is done manually, consuming significant employee time and increasing the risk of errors. With growing document volumes, the firm faces scalability challenges and inefficiencies in their processes.

## Benefits

- **Automated Extraction:** Watsonx Orchestrate automatically extracts relevant data from documents, eliminating manual entry.
- **Workflow Integration:** The extracted data is seamlessly integrated into the firm’s systems (e.g., billing and accounting), speeding up the process.
- **Confidence Review:** If the extraction confidence is low, a review step ensures data accuracy without delays.
